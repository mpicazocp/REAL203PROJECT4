Project 4 Wesley Curl and Elizabeth Picazo //FIND CODE AT ELIZABETH PICAZO'S GITHUB (mpicazocp)
1. Our event is triggered by clicking the mouse. The event then happens at the Point location where the mouse is located.

2. When the event is triggered 'aliens' picture by wyvern images are spawn along with a crater around it.

3. Miners are the targeted by the crater. When a miner comes within the radius of a crater it comes to 'freak out'. The
miner image will change to a miner with its hands up and 'run' (move quicker) away.

4. The new entity 'Alien' will spawn at the middle of a crater. Its purpose is to chase miners and eat them! AHHH!

5. Wesley Curl: changed the background, created the crater and worked on the Alien
   Elizabeth: worked on the alien, developed the changing images and UML.
