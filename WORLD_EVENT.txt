Project 4 Wesley Curl and Elizabeth Picazo //FIND CODE AT ELIZABETH PICAZO'S GITHUB (mpicazocp)
1. Our event is triggered by clicking the mouse. The event then happens at the Point location where the mouse is located.

2. When the event is triggered 'aliens' pictured by evil dancing bananas are spawn along with a crater around it.

3. Miners are the targeted by the crater. When the crater appears, nearby miners 'freak out' and turn into dancing pickles as they run away from the bananas.

4. The new entity 'Alien' will spawn at the middle of a crater. Its purpose is to chase miners and eat them! AHHH!

5. Wesley Curl: changed the background, created the crater and worked on the Alien
   Elizabeth Picazo: worked on the alien, developed the changing images and UML.
